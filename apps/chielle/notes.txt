This is the unhardened version. The hardened version has to be generated using their tool (available)?

Key:
data-flow techniques:
	Software protection for the data stored in registers or memory
control-flow techinques:
	Software protection for the program exection order

VAR:
	- A set of seventeen data-flow techniques that aim at reducing overheads in performances,
	  memory and energy consuption
	- As the variation # increases, the amount of checking rules decreases. See TABLE 1 and TABLE 2
	  in "Reliability on ARM processors against Soft Errors by a Purely Software Approach"
	  (Eduardo Chielle, IEEE 2015)

Source Code Naming Conventions:
	- p = +
